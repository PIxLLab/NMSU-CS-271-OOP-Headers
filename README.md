# NMSU-CS-271-OOP-Headers

This repository contains the files needed to run many of the examples in Prof. Stroustrup's Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++. These are the original header files provided by Prof. Stroustrup at (https://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/). I have cloned them here for use in assignments for NMSU's CS 271 course, since some of those pages are not available. I have tested and edited as needed.

**Note that we use C++11, so to compile code using these headers, you have to be using the C++11 standard.**
