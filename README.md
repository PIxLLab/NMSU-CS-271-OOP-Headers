# nmsu-cs-271-oop-header
 
This is the header file provided by Prof. Stroustrup for Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++. The original is hosted at (https://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/std_lib_facilities.h). I have cloned it here for use in assignments for NMSU's CS 271 course, since some of those pages are not available.

**Note that to compile code using this header file, you have to be using the C++11 standard.**
